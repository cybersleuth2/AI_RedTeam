## Overview

**Prompt-based reconstruction** involves using the outputs from a **language model (LLM)** to infer or reconstruct specific details from training data. In this case, it focuses on leveraging prompt manipulation to reconstruct private or sensitive information indirectly by querying a large pre-trained model.

An attacker might exploit an LLM by crafting specific inputs (prompts) that trigger the model to reveal information it was trained on, without directly accessing training data.

---

## Key Concepts

* **Prompt Injection**: Manipulating the input prompt in a way that forces the LLM to provide unintended or sensitive information.
* **Training Data Leakage**: LLMs can memorize parts of the training data, leading to leakage when prompted correctly.
* **Reconstruction via Prompting**: Reconstructing sensitive or private information by carefully designing input prompts that "ask" the LLM about specific aspects of the data it was trained on.

---

## Methods and Techniques

### 1. **Direct Prompting**

Directly asking the LLM to provide specific pieces of information. For example:

```text
What was the content of the document titled 'Confidential Report X'?
```

* The LLM can sometimes return information from the training set if it has memorized parts of it.
* **Command**: You can query LLMs like GPT, GPT-3, or others to infer information.

### 2. **Indirect Prompting with Chaining**

Building a chain of prompts that guides the model toward revealing information step by step. This is an advanced form of **prompt engineering**.

For example:

1. **Prompt 1**: "Please describe the details of the research paper related to AI ethics published in 2020."
2. **Prompt 2**: "What specific dataset was used to train models for AI ethics in 2020?"

By using indirect queries, an attacker may try to obtain data references or specific model behaviors.

### 3. **Memory Reconstruction**

Using the LLM's memory of previous queries to reconstruct parts of the input training data. If the model is queried repeatedly or persistently, it might return sensitive information over time.

### 4. **Adversarial Prompting**

Manipulating prompts to get the LLM to generate sensitive or private data. For example, forcing the model to "forget" certain information by repeatedly asking about its training sources or configurations.

## Example Code for Prompt-Based Reconstruction

Below is an example of how an attacker might manipulate the prompt and use it for reconstruction using Python and the OpenAI API.

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install openai
```

### Code Example

```python
import openai

openai.api_key = 'your-api-key-here'

def query_llm(prompt):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",  # or use other available models
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=200
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Example: Direct prompt for reconstruction
prompt = "What was the content of the research paper titled 'Confidential Report X'?"
response = query_llm(prompt)
print("LLM Response:", response)

# Example: Chaining prompts
prompt_1 = "Describe the AI ethics research published in 2020."
response_1 = query_llm(prompt_1)
print("LLM Response to Prompt 1:", response_1)

prompt_2 = "What datasets were used to train models for AI ethics in 2020?"
response_2 = query_llm(prompt_2)
print("LLM Response to Prompt 2:", response_2)
```

## Tools and Frameworks

* **OpenAI GPT-3, GPT-4**: Popular models used for prompt-based reconstruction and inference.

* **HuggingFace Transformers**: Open-source library to access multiple pre-trained models for prompt generation and manipulation.

* **TextAttack**: A library designed to attack machine learning models, including LLMs, through adversarial prompt attacks.

  Installation:

  ```bash
  pip install textattack
  ```

* **Prompt Engineering Libraries**: Tools like `LangChain` can help you build more complex prompt chains.

  Installation:

  ```bash
  pip install langchain
  ```

## Privacy and Security Risks

* **Data Leakage**: The LLM may inadvertently output sensitive or private data from its training set.
* **Model Exploits**: Attackers can exploit the LLM by constructing cleverly designed prompts that trick the model into revealing information.
* **Federated or Multi-Model Risks**: When multiple entities or models are involved, an attacker may be able to reconstruct data across models by combining different prompt responses.

| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Input Sanitization**   | Use pre-processing to filter out sensitive content in the prompt before passing it to the LLM.                  |
| **Model Fine-Tuning**    | Retrain models with an emphasis on privacy by removing sensitive data from training sets.                       |
| **Query Limiting**       | Limit how much can be revealed by controlling the length and type of queries made to the LLM.                   |
| **Differential Privacy** | Apply differential privacy techniques to the model to ensure that outputs do not reveal individual data points. |
| **Prompt Filtering**     | Use prompt filters that prevent certain types of queries or control the model's output.                         |

## Ethical Considerations

* **Misuse of models**: Prompt-based reconstruction can be used maliciously to extract sensitive data.
* **Model ownership and privacy**: The models may unintentionally violate the privacy rights of individuals if they have been trained on sensitive data without proper anonymization.
* **Legal implications**: Depending on the use case, retrieving and using such data might violate GDPR, HIPAA, or other privacy laws.
